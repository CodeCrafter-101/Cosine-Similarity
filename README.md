# Cosine Similarity
## Definition
- Cosine Similarity is a metric used to measure how similar two vectors are irrespective of their magnitude. It is widely used in fields like Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval, and Recommendation Systems to determine the similarity between documents, sentences, or feature vectors.
- The cosine similarity value ranges between -1 and 1, where:
  - 1 indicates exactly similar
  - 0 indicates no similarity (orthogonal)
  - -1 indicates completely opposite

## Requirements
- Libraries
  - `numpy`
  - `sklearn` (optional, for pairwise cosine similarity)
  - `nltk` or `scikit-learn` (optional, for text vectorization)
### To install dependencies:
- ````
  pip install numpy scikit-learn
  ````
